					<p>I have a son named Austin (9yrs) and a daughter named Kylie (5yrs) and a wife named Tara. We also have a border collie / poodle mix named Bandit who keeps us busy!</p>
					<p>Everything I'm passionate about in life generally revolves around making things better. I'm not the type of person that likes to sit still when there are so many things that can done! One day I will sit down and enjoy everything I've worked for, but for now I'm gonna to keep on keepin' on.</p>
					<p>Finding web development has allowed me to never have to work a day in my life, I just get to play with code instead!.</p>

					<p>Only 1 agency!? Yes, but this is not your standard run of the mill web development experience, it has been so much more. build create is a digital agency that tackles custom web design and development, as well as digital marketing and content strategy solutions.</p>
					<p>I hired on in the beginning of build create's existance as a part-time contractor to tackle some overflow development work. This was my first real taste of agency work as a developer and I quickly began to learn how to anticipate client needs and appropriately planning for the projects' future. Soon after that I hired on full time.</p>
					<p>I've been growing with the company for 8 years, working with hundreds of new and retained clients. I've been fortunate enough to not only experience great successes, but also failures. Learning from it all has been invaluable to consistently innovate and improve my processes with every new project I tackle.</p>

		<div class="wrapper">
			<h2>These are some of the things I've done.</h2>
			<div class="skillset-wrap">
				<div class="left">
					<p>My primary development experience revolves around <em>Wordpress</em>, the technologies it uses, and the <em>server environments</em> it lives on. Almost every site that I build is using the <em>Wordpress platform</em> and a <em>custom theme</em> I develop from the ground up.</p>
					<p>I will write <em>custom functionality</em> over <em>installing a plugin</em> whenever I can. There's nothing wrong with some plugins, I've even written a few <em>custom plugins</em>, but when a simple function can replace a plugin I do it every time. I tend to look for effeciencies like this with every aspect of my development process. The web moves fast, sometimes so fast that every new project I pick up is configured completely different. <em>Modernizr</em> and <em>CSS compilers</em> have changed our stylesheets forever and I jumped on board as quick as I could. <em>GIT versioning</em> is one of the best tools available and will continue to provide peace of mind for coders and site owners alike.</p>
					<p><em>Web Host</em> & <em>DNS management</em> are a few more important skills I've accrued over time. I've learned that there are no shortcuts here and using a reputable <em>Web Host</em> and a properly configured <em>DNS</em> is a must. I've worked with many <em>web hosts</em> and <em>registrars</em> now and can vouch first hand that 'you get what you pay for'. Most of the sites I've worked on have been on <em>LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)</em> stacks in various forms. I've setup <em>dedicated servers</em> from scratch, used <em>VPS solutions</em>, and even have had a few sites on shared hosting. Recently, the switch from <em>Apache</em> to <em>NGINX</em> and <em>PHP 7.x</em> have given our <em>Wordpress</em> sites some serious performance boosts. This combined with proper <em>image optimization</em>, <em>caching</em> and <em>code minification</em> really sets them up for a good rating when Google checks the page speed.</p>
					<p>Over the past 8 years I've worked pretty closely with my designer, project manager and sales staff and have picked up skills from them whenever possible. I've learned a lot about purposeful <em>design</em> and effective <em>UI implementation</em> to keep site user experiences as painless as possible. I regularly take the feedback from the experiences with my colleagues and clients and have adjust my development process accordingly. I like to think I'm good at what I do and I will never sit still because I know the moment I do, I will already be behind.</p>

				<h2>Formal & informal education.</h2>
				<p>Throughout my professional career I've completed various types of education both formal and informal.</p>
			</div>
				
			<div class="education-wrap">
				<div class="education-item">
					<h3>Central Michigan University</h3>
					<address>Mt. Pleasant, MI</address>
					<p><em>2000-2004</em></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Bachelors of Applied Arts</li>
						<li>Majored in Entreprenuership</li>
						<li>Minored in Hospitality</li>
					</ul>
					<p>During my years at CMU I worked for the University IT department as a technology assistant for residents living on campus. My duties included visiting residents homes to repair their personal devices by removing viruses, spyware, malware and optimizing the operating system.</p>
					<p>While attending CMU I grew as an adult, learned who I really am, what I really want out of life, and how to get it.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="education-item">
					<h3>Washtenaw Community College</h3>
					<address>Ann Arbor, MI</address>
					<p><em>2008-2010</em></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Certificate in Foundations of Computer Systems</li>
						<li>Certificate in Web Design and Development</li>
						<li>Advanced Certificate in Web Development</li>
					</ul>
					<p>WCC is one of those underrated schools where you see "Community College" in the school name and dismiss the legitimacy of its education. Not this program. Every single professor leading my courses were industry professionals that could really relate the curriculum to real world experiences.</p>
					<p>I am very pleased with my experience at WCC and feel very strongly that it suitably prepared me for entering the workforce with a creative agency.</p>
				</div>				
				<div class="education-item">
					<h3>Continuing education</h3>
					<address>Ann Arbor, MI</address>
					<p><em>2011-Present</em></p>
					<p>This is another "informal" education entry however I have to make note of this since it has been such a big part of my development process so far in my career.</p>
					<p>An unwritten rule that I've created for myself is that if I ever find myself with a bit of downtime, an opportunity has presented itself to learn. By simply looking around the internet for web development trends and coding techniques I've managed to regularly find new things to try out. Some of which I will never use, some of which I implement immediately.</p>
					<p>I believe if you are not trying to innovate, you are falling behind.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="education-item">
					<h3>Wordcamp</h3>
					<address>Ann Arbor, MI | Detroit, MI | Grand Rapids, MI | Chicago, IL</address>
					<p><em>2013-Present</em></p>
					<p>This falls squarely in the "informal education" category but in my opinion is just as important as formal education, if not more. This is where I learn what the "real world" is really up to. Networking with other industry professionals really gives me an idea on where the Wordpress market stands and helps to inform how I need to respond to an ever changing development climate.</p>
					<p>Attending these conferences is invaluable to innovation and growth ensuring that my skillset and process stays ahead of the industry's standard curve.</p>
