                    I have a son named Austin (13yrs) and a daughter named Kylie (9yrs) and a wife named Tara.
                    We also have a border collie / poodle mix named Bandit who is an objectively hilarious animal
                    that we love very much. We currently reside in the greater Ann Arbor, Michigan area.

                    I'm the type of person who is curious about everything and loves figuring out why things are
                    the way they are.
                    Everything I'm passionate about seems to always revolve around identifying a problem and
                    figuring out a way to make it better.

                    <p>
                        Yes, but hear me out, there is a bit more to unpack here. I have not experienced a typical
                        web development experience, it has been so much more. build create is a digital agency that
                        offers scratch built custom web design and development, as well as digital marketing and content
                        strategy solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hired on in the beginning as a part-time contractor to tackle some overflow development work.
                        This was my first real taste of agency work as a developer and I quickly began growing my
                        skillset to better anticipate client needs while appropriately planning for the projects'
                        future. Soon after that I hired on full time.

                    <h4>Each new project is an opportunity to innovate.</h4>
                    <p>
                        I've been growing with the company for 13 years, working with hundreds of very
                        diverse clients. I've been fortunate enough to not only experience great successes, but also
                        learn from failures along the way. My experience with build create has been invaluable and
                        has proven that anything is possible if you put your mind to it.

            <h2>These are some of the things I've done.</h2>
            <div class="skillset-wrap">
                <div class="left">
                    <p>My primary development experience revolves around <em>Wordpress</em>, the technologies it uses,
                        and the <em>server environments</em> it lives on. Almost every site that I build is using the
                        <em>Wordpress platform</em> and a <em>custom theme</em> I develop from the ground up.
                    </p>
                    <p>I will write <em>custom functionality</em> over <em>installing a plugin</em> whenever I can.
                        There's nothing wrong with some plugins, I've even written a few <em>custom plugins</em>, but
                        when a simple function can replace a plugin I do it every time. I tend to look for effeciencies
                        like this with every aspect of my development process. The web moves fast, sometimes so fast
                        that every new project I pick up is configured completely different. <em>Modernizr</em> and
                        <em>CSS compilers</em> have changed our stylesheets forever and I jumped on board as quick as I
                        could. <em>GIT versioning</em> is one of the best tools available and will continue to provide
                        peace of mind for coders and site owners alike.
                    </p>
                    <p><em>Web Host</em> & <em>DNS management</em> are a few more important skills I've accrued over
                        time. I've learned that there are no shortcuts here and using a reputable <em>Web Host</em> and
                        a properly configured <em>DNS</em> is a must. I've worked with many <em>web hosts</em> and
                        <em>registrars</em> now and can vouch first hand that 'you get what you pay for'. Most of the
                        sites I've worked on have been on <em>LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)</em> stacks in various
                        forms. I've setup <em>dedicated servers</em> from scratch, used <em>VPS solutions</em>, and even
                        have had a few sites on shared hosting. Recently, the switch from <em>Apache</em> to
                        <em>NGINX</em> and <em>PHP 7.x</em> have given our <em>Wordpress</em> sites some serious
                        performance boosts. This combined with proper <em>image optimization</em>, <em>caching</em> and
                        <em>code minification</em> really sets them up for a good rating when Google checks the page
                        speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Over the past 13 years I've worked pretty closely with my designer, project manager and sales
                        staff and have picked up skills from them whenever possible. I've learned a lot about purposeful
                        <em>design</em> and effective <em>UI implementation</em> to keep site user experiences as
                        painless as possible. I regularly take the feedback from the experiences with my colleagues and
                        clients and adjust my development process accordingly. I like to think I'm good at what I do and
                        I will never get comfortable with that thought because I know the moment I stop improving my
                        craft, I'll already be behind the competition.

                    <p>While attending CMU I grew as an adult, learned who I really am, what I really want out of life,

                    <p>WCC is one of those underrated schools where you see "Community College" in the school name and
                        dismiss the legitimacy of its education. Not this program. Every single professor leading my
                        courses were industry professionals that could really relate the curriculum to real world
                        experiences.</p>

                    <p>This falls squarely in the "informal education" category but in my opinion is just as important

                        Networking with other industry professionals really gives me an idea on where the Wordpress
                        market stands and helps to inform how I need to respond to an ever changing development climate.

                        An unwritten rule that I've created for myself is that if I ever find myself with a bit of
                        downtime between tasks, an opportunity has presented itself to learn. By simply reading up on
                        current web development and design trends, I regularly find new things to try out. Some of
                        which I will never use, some of which I implement immediately.
