                    I have a son named Austin (13yrs) and a daughter named Kylie (9yrs) and a wife named Tara.
                    We also have a border collie / poodle mix named Bandit who is an objectively hilarious animal
                    that we love very much. We currently reside in the greater Ann Arbor, Michigan area.

                    I'm the type of person who is curious about everything and loves figuring out why things are
                    the way they are.
                    Everything I'm passionate about seems to always revolve around identifying a problem and
                    figuring out a way to make it better.

                        Yes, but hear me out, there is a bit more to unpack here. I have not experienced a typical
                        web development experience, it has been so much more. build create is a digital agency that
                        offers scratch built custom web design and development, as well as digital marketing and content
                        strategy solutions.

                    <p>
                        I hired on in the beginning as a part-time contractor to tackle some overflow development work.
                        This was my first real taste of agency work as a developer and I quickly began growing my
                        skillset to better anticipate client needs while appropriately planning for the projects'
                        future. Soon after that I hired on full time.

                    <p>
                        I've been growing with the company for 13 years, working with hundreds of very
                        diverse clients. I've been fortunate enough to not only experience great successes, but also
                        learn from failures along the way. My experience with build create has been invaluable and
                        has proven that anything is possible if you put your mind to it.

            <h2>These are some of the things I have experience with and regularly use in my development process.</h2>
            <div class="intro">
                <p>
                    My primary development experience revolves around building custom themes for <em>Wordpress</em> from
                    the ground up. The tech stack involved is usually a <em>mySQL database</em> with an
                    <em>NGINX server</em> but in the past has been an <em>Apache server</em> running
                    <em>WHM & cPanel</em>. I have experience with many webhosts including <em>Pantheon</em>,
                    <em>WP Engine</em> & <em>LiquidWeb</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also developed custom sites using <em>React</em> and <em>Next JS</em>. These sites are more
                    flexible with their tech stack setup but are usually hosted on <em>Vercel (nextjs)</em> or on a
                    custom server at <em>Digital Ocean</em>. For all the content management needs I've built custom CMS
                    backends which generally use <em>Mongo DB</em>.

                    <p>WCC is one of those underrated schools where you see "Community College" in the school name and
                        dismiss the legitimacy of its education. Not this program. Every single professor leading my
                        courses were industry professionals that could really relate the curriculum to real world
                        experiences.</p>

                    <p>This falls squarely in the "informal education" category but in my opinion is just as important
                        as formal education, if not more. This is where I learn what the "real world" is really up to.
                        Networking with other industry professionals really gives me an idea on where the Wordpress
                        market stands and helps to inform how I need to respond to an ever changing development climate.

                        This is another "informal" education entry however I have to make note of this since it has been
                        such a big part of the development process so far in my career.

                        An unwritten rule that I've created for myself is that if I ever find myself with a bit of
                        downtime between tasks, an opportunity has presented itself to learn. By simply reading up on
                        current web development and design trends, I regularly find new things to try out. Some of
                        which I will never use, some of which I implement immediately.
